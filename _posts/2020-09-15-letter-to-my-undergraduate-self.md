title: "Letter To My Undergraduate Self"
---

Going to a university is important because you not only learn about the subject of your choice to build a foundation for your career, but also it is the place where your ideas and opinions about the world are formed and your personality is developed. For many it is the beginning of their independent life and teaches them how to overcome hurdles on their own.

I loved my time in my undergraduate. Not because my college was great or anything, it was hardly average, but because I made many great friends for life, tasted independence and the cost associated with it, and tried to explore many new things and failed miserably or gave up halfway in most of them. But when I look back, there are some things which I feel I could have done way better and some amazing opportunities which I completely let pass by me. I am writing this to myself to introspect where I could have improved back then so that I can improve right now and if someone else finds this useful, I will be a happy person. 

Don’t take this as a structure or guiding principle of your university life. It is your youth life and you have to shape it yourself, not let others shape it for you because if you let others shape your life for you then you are not learning anything. On top of that, you are losing your freedom and a major part of yourself. I am a believer in Herman Hesse’s philosophy (in his book Siddhartha). Learn from everything that comes to you, analyse it, absorb the good things, let go of the negative things, and then go on your journey to find what you are and explore your life, because it is yours. Remember, the meaning of life is not to copy a billionaire or a sports person and become successful like them. The meaning of life is - why. Why is this your life? Why do you want to live your life? Be yourself, not imitate others. 

In Zen Buddhism there is a saying (or *koan* as they call it) which I truly love. “When you meet the Buddha, kill him.” What it means is be open and courageous even towards things you don’t know. Don’t follow Buddha as is, rather learn from him and go on your own path. Resume your own Buddha. There is no path in life. If there is a path in your life, you are living someone else’s life.

Here are some of things which improved me and I recommend them to everyone. 

# Read More

The habit that brought about the biggest positive change in me is reading which I inculcated in myself during my sophomore year. I used to read books prior to that as well but reading wasn't such a habit per se. I barely read 3-4 books a year. If at that point you had asked me which was the last book I had read, I would have said 1984 by George Orwell, which I had read almost an year before.

I started with a goal in mind - 50 books in 2017 - and I was lucky enough that the first book I picked, Steve Jobs by Walter Issacson, really inspired me to do what I wanted to do.

Why I recommend reading as habit to everyone is because of three reasons (or positive changes which I have felt in myself) - 

1. **Reading teaches patience -** At first, it is very difficult to sit down with a book for 30 minutes and focus on nothing but the text. You won’t be able to concentrate properly because there are too many distractions around and the biggest is the mobile phone and social media. In terms of negative effects on patience, mobile phones and social media train your mind towards short and quick sources of information, like Facebook notifications, news pop-ups, etc, and because of that many find it really hard to sit calmly through a book. Ask yourself, can you or your friends sit alone for an hour without getting impatient about not checking their phones? If the answer is no, you know you lack self-control and patience. If the answer is yes, you are doing quite well and you have an amazing company of people!

2. **You learn a lot -** Reading any book, irrespective of the genre, teaches you how to frame your thoughts and convey them, increases your vocabulary, improves your grammar and teaches you how to write. Reading non-fiction especially teaches you about things like history, science, and great people, for example. No matter which genre you are reading, you end up learning a lot of things. The only genre of books that I don’t recommend is cheap modern fiction because they do not make any sense to me - there is no literature in them. 

3. **You learn about yourself -** Reading is like meditation. It is a conversation between yourself and the writer. Fully absorbing the meaning of the words requires a certain amount of focus. In understanding what the writer is trying to convey, you will sometimes realise that you know so little about this topic or your opinions about a particular topic is narrow, biased etc. This introspection opens up a tunnel to your consciousness and helps to clear your thinking. I believe this introspection is essential for assessing yourself.

# Change my attitude and be curious and welcoming

Reality is neutral. The world is how we perceive it to be. It is only after changing your attitude that you will learn to be welcoming towards new challenges and be positive. Three main changes in my attitude which really made me better -

1. Be curious about everything and learn new things, not just the things that are related to your field of study, but also other disparate fields. For example, if you are studying computer science, learn psychology and try to see computer science through glasses of psychology.

2. Be welcoming towards change. Life is like a sine graph, it is never constant. Changes will come and it is our attitude that defines how we deal with it.

3. Be responsible for your actions and life. Don’t blame your failures on circumstances or family, especially on your parents. They have tried hard and sacrificed a lot to make sure you become a better person - better than they are. 

# Learn to think, write and speak

We are social animals and as social animals one of the most important qualities that any of us can possess is to think logically and in a heuristic way by taking first principles into considerations and write down clearly what you think and be able to speak them out cogently. These skills are essential in modern day and age because society is so intertwined that you will have to constantly communicate with others and persuade them if you want to progress towards your goal. Interviews, persuasion, salary hikes, relationships, etc are just some examples where a good communication skill can pay off huge dividends.

This is one field where I still lack. What works best, according to me, is to write daily for at least 30 mins and try to speak to yourself what you just read in a book or article. It improves the clarity of the chain of your thoughts and also helps to shuffle and select striking points.

# Take control of my life early on

You cannot get complete freedom until you take control of certain aspects of your life and don’t worry about things that are not in your control.

What I found most helpful was to create a schedule and follow it. At first it takes a lot of effort to adjust yourself accordingly but after sometime you find it quite revitalizing. At first you might be able to stick to only 50% of your schedule and that’s fine. Try to make it 55% the next day. Remember the process to follow a schedule is incremental not instantaneous. Some unprecedented things will always come to break you out of the schedule and that is completely okay. Life is, after all, like a wave with ups and downs, not a still ocean. From my experience, the optimal stick-to-itiveness to a schedule is around 90% and I don’t think anyone can stick to their schedule 100% of the time because life is serendipitous.

# Cutting procrastination and working harder

Occasional procrastination is normal but if you are procrastinating everytime, skipping your work to nap for thirty minutes, or your tasks in your to-do-list are increasing constantly, then you are procrastinating and need to get back on the driver’s seat. 

Some things I found quite useful to tackle procrastination - 

1. **There is no fun in procrastination -**  For example, if you complete your work on time, you get more time to focus on your hobbies or watch a movie. Even resting with an empty mind is way better than pretending to work.

2. **Making a schedule -** Schedule really helps in arranging your day to utilise it to the fullest. That is why many CEOs have such a tight schedule to get maximum out of their day. Also, schedule provides a sort of supervision that helps to make sure you are on the correct path.

3. **Cut social media -** One of the best things I have done in my life is delete Facebook. But eventually I got addicted to Twitter and Instagram and it was consuming a lot of my time, focus and emotions and increased my procrastination. The thing that works for me is to open Twitter and Instagram only in a half an hour window during the evening coffee break.

# Going on more trips

Explore things that are around you, collect experiences, travel, be in nature. I have been to many trips but there were a couple of them I missed and I still regret them. Nevertheless, it's never too late to plan another trip.

# Being in the present

If you think about the future, you will be constantly worried. If you think about the past, you will be constantly regretful. What has happened and will happen is not in your control. What is in your control is what can happen.

I have lived a substantial chunk of my undergraduate life thinking about how things could have been or how things should have been but I was rarely mindful of how things actually are. Having this kind of mental state is akin to living in a pseudo-simulation, where you are living in a self-created illusion which seems real to you but, on the contrary, reality becomes an illusion.

Learn from the past, be mindful and conscious of the things in hand, and shape your future.

Be lively, fun loving. Search for love, spread love.
