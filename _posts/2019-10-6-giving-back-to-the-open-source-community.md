title: "Giving back to the open source community"
---

I have been using open source software in my daily life for over 2 years now. The open source community has helped me in my studies, interview preparations and in general to become a better software engineer. The community has given a lot to the world and because of open source, softwares and computers have become so pervasive in our daily lifes. This is the time for me to give something back to the community.

While preparing for my interviews, I did many Leetcode, HackerRank and GeeksForGeeks problems in Python and felt that if there was a GitHub repo where I could find implementations of all data structures and algorithms, it would help many students. So I set out to compile all the problems I did in a single place. Hence I created the [python-ds](https://github.com/prabhupant/python-ds) repo.

Feel free to raise issues, file PR and contribute to this repo :)

And don't forget to fork and star ;)
