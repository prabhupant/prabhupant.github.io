title: "Making hacking in Python easier"
---

For the last 3 months I have been writing many Python scripts to automate stuffs, make API calls, parse things, getting data from Mongo dump, interacting with MySQL and AWS and stuff other random scripts to get things done. In these times I realise that how vulnerable I can be when I can't recall the code from my memory and have to Google it but I just can't find it due to time constrain or too much work at hand or just utter laziness and ineffective Googling.

That's why I am starting this GitHub repo [python-boilerplate](https://github.com/prabhupant/python-boilerplate) to share enough Python code across various domains like DB, web, parsing, etc to get things done. Just a quick copy paste and some modifications here and there and you are good to go.

I hope this project gets some traction and involvement of community will definitely help it to include many different boilerplate snippets.
