I am *Prabhu Pant*, a software engineer based in Bangalore, India.

For the last two years I have been writing code in Python and have been working in fintech since June 2019. I love to learn new things across different fields. This curiosity has led me to foray into many fields, some of my favorites are psychology, philosophy, history, geography and science.

I write on many things - technologies, psychology, philosphy, movies, photography, and football. Find my fiction writings [here on Medium](https://medium.com/@heyPrabhu)

Other that exploring and working in computer technologies, I love playing guitar, photography, football, reading, learning new things, and running long distances
